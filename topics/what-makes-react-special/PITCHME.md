What do you notice?

- We are creating our own HTML-type elements |
- The HTML is within the JavaScript |

+++

Going back to our previous metaphor

- The director is controlling the script directly

What React gives you

+++

React is only the view layer

- React only defines how it renders on the browser |
- Other frameworks actually define how you handle data |

+++

React uses a virtual DOM

- React maintains it's own copy of the DOM |
- Only changes are sent to the browser to be updated |

+++

React focusses on separation of concerns rather than separation os technologies

- HTML and JS are together |
- They actually work together |

+++

React gives you readable, maintainable code

- Everything is componentized |
